                    We are available by phone 1-877-311-3883 to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Site. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. We and you (each a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties") shall use our best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>
                <p class="style-90">If the Parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the previous paragraph, then either Party may initiate binding arbitration. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions (including their formation, performance and breach), the Parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Site shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") in accordance with the provisions of its Consumer Arbitration Rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.<br class="style-91" /> <br class="style-92" />
                    The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and Conditions, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms and Conditions is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the Parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br class="style-93" /> <br class="style-94" />
                    The Parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.<br class="style-95" /> <br class="style-96" />
                    If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration shall take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, and you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<br class="style-97" /> <br class="style-98" />
                    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms and Conditions shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms and Conditions, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.<br class="style-99" /> <br class="style-100" />
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing, we agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>

Any changes are effective immediately upon posting to the Site and release of notice of such change. Your continued use of the Site thereafter constitutes your agreement to all such changed Terms and Conditions. We may, with or without prior notice, terminate any of the rights granted by these Terms and Conditions.

Our failure to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not affect our full right to require such performance at any time thereafter, nor shall our waiver of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by any applicable arbitral award or court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms and Conditions unenforceable or invalid as a whole but these Terms and Conditions shall be modified, to the extent possible, by the adjudicating entity to most fully reflect the original intent of the parties as reflected in the original provision. The headings in the Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and shall not be used in its interpretation.</p>
